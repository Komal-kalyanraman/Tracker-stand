This code is edited from the link given below.

https://github.com/ITCoders/Human-detection-and-Tracking

This code is made QT compatible by creating a new CMakeLists.txt file and by making changes in main.cpp file. Code from the link 
has to be unzipped into "src" folder and a build folder has to be created beside the src folder. QT is configred to build in it and
only "main.cpp" has to be replaced and CMakeLists.txt file has to be added. Rest are same. An error will occur at run time. This 
will be due to the wrong path of the XML files and the video files in "main.cpp".
